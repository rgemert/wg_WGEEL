Question about DK_total

Concerning the annex 15 of the data call. 
In general DK has one EMU which is DK_Inla additional there is an obtion  DK_total (that is used by me as a management unit covering all marine areas). But in annex 15 there is no DK_total option

There is isn't it ?

You can use it. This is for the management units
